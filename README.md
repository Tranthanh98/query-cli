## Features

- **Multi-database support** — PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MySQL
- **Keyboard-driven TUI** — built with [OpenTUI](https://opentui.com) and React
- **Query editor** — tabbed queries with syntax highlighting, save/rename, and clipboard copy
- **Schema explorer** — browse tables, columns, and indexes side-by-side
- **AI assistant** — generate and explain SQL using Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, or Google Gemini
- **Slash commands** — quick actions like `/export`, `/clear`, `/quit`, and more
- **Connection manager** — save, edit, and switch between database connections

## Install

```bash
npm i -g query-cli
```

`query-cli` is distributed as a self-contained binary per platform, so you don't need Bun or Node.js installed.

## Usage

```bash
query-cli
```

On first launch, you'll land on the **connection selection** screen. Add a new connection, pick a driver, and start querying.

### Keybindings

| Key (Linux / Windows) | macOS | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `F5` / `Ctrl + R` | `F5` / `Control + R` | Run query |
| `F9` / `Ctrl + P` | `F9` / `Control + P` | Open command palette |
| `Ctrl + S` | `Control + S` | Save query |
| `Ctrl + N` | `Control + N` | New query |
| `Ctrl + D` | `Control + D` | Delete query |
| `Ctrl + Y` | `Control + Y` | Copy selection to clipboard |
| `F1` / `Ctrl + H` | `F1` / `Control + H` | Show keyboard shortcuts help |
| `Ctrl + C` | `Control + C` | Quit |

> **Note:** `Ctrl+S` may freeze some Unix terminals (XOFF). Press `Ctrl+Q` to resume, or disable flow control with `stty -ixon`.

> Tab management (new, switch, save, rename, delete) and other actions are available through slash commands in the editor — type `/` to see the list.

## Development

query-cli requires [Bun](https://bun.com). It uses OpenTUI's native Zig libraries and will not run on Node.js.

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run in watch mode
bun run dev

# Run once
bun run start

# Type check
bun run typecheck

# Compile standalone binary
bun run compile
```
